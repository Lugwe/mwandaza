              <td>EFFECTS OF LAND COVER PATTERN ON LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE IN URBAN LANDSCAPES: A Case Study of Nairobi CBD</td>
              <td>Rapid urbanization has led to increased land surface temperature (LST) and severe urban heat islands (UHIs). The impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) on LST have been extensively studied. However the differences between land use and land cover and their implications in an urban environment are often overlooked. This study aimed to study the effects from land use types and land cover patterns on LST along urbanization. The LST and LULC data of the study area were obtained from a Landsat ETM+ image and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS respectively. Then landscape metrics were selected and calculated for analyzing the land cover patterns. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were undertaken to determine the relationship between LST and land cover patterns at the land use level. The results showed that it was inadequate to treat land cover as the single factor affecting LST. Furthermore LST values did not simply decrease along the urbanization at the land use level. Even though land cover patterns significantly affected LST land cover variables related to LST varied greatly among the various land use types. The findings in our study provide additional knowledge for optimizing land cover patterns associated with different land use types which may mitigate the adverse impacts of UHIs at a fine scale.</td>

              <td>One of the most damaging natural disasters with socio-economic and environmental effects is flooding. Comprehensive flood control is therefore necessary in order to reduce the impact of flooding on human lives and livelihoods. The main objective of the current study is to investigate the application in Tana River County Kenya of the frequency ratio (FR) model for flood susceptibility mapping. A flood inventory map was initially prepared. In total the study area identified 100 flood locations. Of these 70 (70%) floods have been randomly chosen as training data and the remaining 30 (30%) cases have been used for validation purposes. In the next step from the spatial database flood conditioning variables such as lithology land use river distance soil texture slope angle slope aspect plan curvature topographic wetness index (TWI) and stream power index were prepared. Subsequently the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for produced flood susceptibility maps and the area under the curves (AUCs) was computed. The final results indicated that the accuracy for the final flood susceptibility map was 78.6%. Therefore these flood susceptibility maps can be useful for researchers and planner in flood mitigation strategies.</td>

              <td>CRIME INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND AUTOMATION USING WEBGIS AND USSD</td>
              <td>There is a high rate of crime in Kenya especially in Nairobi Mombasa Kisumu and coastal beach resorts. There are regular reports of these crime incidences to various stations in the country. Analysis of the state of crime in the country is highly dependent on these in-person reports. However not all criminal offences are reported to police stations due to various reasons such as unacquaintance with the nearest police station threats fear of judgement and ridicule by police officers poor of lack of internet connectivity incompatible handset devices etc. Spatial analysis is hindered by the use of paper-based recording and unreported cases. This means that some cases go unreported and therefore analysing crime data that is only reported to police stations may not be sufficient. Moreover with the limit of using outdated techniques such as pushpins on paper maps law enforcement agencies are limited to the amount spatial analysis that can be performed with such manual techniques. The aim of this study is to develop a crime information management system that will collectively automate the process of offline and online crime reporting validating analysing and presenting aggregate and station-based data using Web GIS Remote sensing and USSD. The result of this study was a system is composed of a crime reporting interface for victims to report crime incidences a police station interface for police officers to review reported crimes and respond to victims and a dashboard interface for law enforcement agencies such as senior police commanders to spatially overlay and analyse crime data with remote sensing imagery in order to formulate decisions that will curb crime rates. The study also incorporates the use of Service Workers Indexed DB Sync manager and USSD to enable reporting via GSM cellular telephones or offline sync capability. The system was built on HTML and CSS for frontend and NodeJS for backend. Based on the resultant system it was concluded that having such a system in place would enable timely crime reporting show existing patterns and relationships between crime events and various remote sensing data sources therefore providing a good opportunity for timely and informed decision making thereby helping in curb crime. It was also concluded that with the ability to report crime offline or through USSD channels increases the likelihood of victims reporting crime incidences increases and therefore data captured gives a better representation of diverse livelihood. Every crime is based on a geographical location and thus understanding and representing crime spatially makes it easy for management and monitoring. The study demonstrates the use of GIS and Remote Sensing in Crime Information Management. Crime is an event that is spatio-temporal in nature thus spatial visualisation and analysis provides an easy solution to represent understand manage and monitor crime data/information.</td>

              <td>GIS IN SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT. A case study of GATE C JUJA</td>
              <td>Rising population and living standards increase the rate at which municipal waste is being generated. This increases the amount of resources consumed from the municipal waste budget thus raising the need for a resource-efficient system of collecting the waste. The study area is faced with the negative effects of an ineffective and inefficient waste collection system. These effects are illegal dumping in open spaces littering of streets missed and uncollected waste bags and high costs of collecting waste. This research aims to solve the above problems by proposing the establishment of shared waste collection points across the study area. As the first objective the present solid waste collection system of the area is reviewed and mapped by carrying interviews collecting data and generating maps and a report. Secondly optimum collection points were analyzed from possible locations chosen using the following factors from literature: convenient walking distance from buildings accessible and convenient to waste collectors and convenient for road users. Optimum locations from these possible locations were analyzed using the minimum facilities approach under the location-allocation function of network analysis. Lastly the optimum collection route to this proposed waste collection point is designed using a least-cost route analysis of network analysis. These resulted in the following findings; the flaws in the current system is due to a resource expensive house to house approach incompleteness of the collection criteria and lack of publicly accesible waste disposal places. The proposed system reduces the number of collection points from 896 to 68 which is a 92% reduction and the distance covered to collect waste is reduced from 215 to 46 kilometers translating to a 78% reduction. This proposed solution will reduce the resources used to collect waste the location of bins will curb illegal dumping and a common accessible collection point will curb uncollected waste bags. This research recommends further research on the use of sensors to monitor the rate at which dustbins in these collection points will be filling for efficient collection.</td>

              <td>Forests form a vital part of an environments’ ecosystem and continuous deforestation would threaten the balance within the ecosystem. Direct factors such as agricultural expansion and indirect factors such as change in the demographic patterns within the Cherangany ecosystem are among the drivers that have aided in increased deforestation within the ecosystem. The quantification of the drivers of deforestation of the Cherangany forests will aid in developing specialized conservation programs. This study therefore aims at assessing the geophysical and socio-economic drivers to deforestation. Optical satellite imagery from LANDSAT was used as the primary data source. Supervised classification was performed yielding five classes that were used in the analysis with accuracy assessments ranging between 80% to 89%. Change analysis was done to determine the changes between the various land cover classes. About 13% of forestland changed to other land cover classes from 1989-2018. Logistic regression was used to quantify the drivers of deforestation. The results show that population density had the highest influence on deforestation. Close proximity to towns and average elevation also had a negative correlation with deforestation.</td>

              <td>REAL TIME AUTOMATED WATER QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM</td>
              <td>Water is a crucial commodity for humanity. We cannot live without it we use it for domestic industrial recreational and for power production through hydro-electric power generation. It is paramount to conserve and protect our water resources if we are to use it in the first place. Water pollution is the contamination of the water caused by human action leading to reduction in the water quality and increased toxicity. Watersheds and systems have been polluted over the years by human and animal waste soil erosion effluent discharge from industries organic waste or agricultural chemicals metals among others. This results in loss of the various applications of water discharge such as water for domestic and industrial use irrigation recreation and many more. Globally many countries in the world experience water pollution; be it contamination of rivers streams lakes and even the ocean and seas. According to the United Nations about 30% of fresh water that is accessible is used for industries and agriculture yet water pollution reduces the available usable water for drinking and other domestic purposes. In Sub-Saharan Africa only 40% of residents have access to clean and safe water. Unsafe drinking water poor sanitation and poor hygiene cause high rate of infection of cholera in region. 42% of the population lack an improved water source within 500m 16% lack proper sanitation and 36% cannot access soap for hand washing. In Kenya water pollution is a major environmental problem. According to the Kenya Water Pollution 2019 statistics 42% of the population are unable to use clean and safe water while 59% of the population does not practice safe sanitation. Furthermore the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera dysentery typhoid among others has become more rampant in the city - “Nairobi County issues a warning on the cholera outbreak” according to The Star Newspaper March 2019. River remediation should be an imperative venture not only locally but also globally. Demographic pressures produce acute water shortages which make the provision of future environmental flows highly unlikely. (Wal Abdul Muhammad et al in Environmental Pollution 2019). Research done on water pollution was done on emphasis on water turbidity in rivers. Turbidity is a measure of light passing through water and the clarity of the water. Most methods of monitoring pollution is done by sampling and testing method; whereby samples are collected and analysed in the laboratory. With increasing levels of pollution in our water systems there is a necessity to monitor and assess the levels in real time to prevent further pollution. There are point and non-point sources of pollution. Using modern sensor technology we can track the pollution and determine the source or extent. State-of-the-art water turbidity meters are being installed in rivers and other water resources to provide an instantaneous turbidity reading. A long device is lowered into the water and at the end is a turbidity sensor that reads turbidity in the river by measuring the amount of light penetration in the water and reading how much light is reflected back to the sensor. These devices can house multiple water-quality sensors such as a conductivity sensor to measure electrical conductance of the water which is strongly influenced by dissolved solids pH sensors among others. The results achieved are in form of graphs and maps showing the level of pollution and the extent. These results aid in monitoring and assessing pollution of a given watershed. Therefore this will inform the public and relevant authorities on how to mitigate and manage the situation. The research gap to be filled include coming up with more sophisticated equipment that is robust and measures various kinds of pollutants in the water in real time such as a combination of turbidity pH temperature dissolved oxygen suspended solids dissolved solids among others.</td>

              <td>Application of Remote Sensing and GIS in Soil Salinity Mapping: A Case Study of Baringo County</td>
              <td>Soil salinity is a global land degradation problem that results into a significant decline in arable land. This is owing to the fact that plants are unable to uptake nutrients from salinized soils. Soil salinity mapping is an important step in reclamation efforts through identification of areas most affected by salinized soils. Remote sensing and GIS data is used by various agencies and institutions for resource management. The Harmonized World Soil Database was the first global salinity data source but had a coarse resolution of >1km. The data available on the database is outdated as the last update was in 2012 (v 1.2). ISRIC and KALRO have made efforts to provide more recent salinity data by combining soil properties with thermal infrared imagery to yield salinity maps. However the maps have spatial resolution of 250m. In this research paper satellite imagery; Landsat 8 OLI was acquired for nine years from 2013 to 2021 for Baringo County in order to investigate the presence extent and trend in soil salinity. Salinity index was calculated from the satellite images for the nine years to create soil salinity maps for Baringo County. One-year epochs were used due to the dynamic nature of soil salinity. Further maps indicating the various levels of salinity; low moderate and high were generated. The years 2013 and 2014 had the largest areas under the high salinity level covering 3570.26km2 and 3501.02 km2 respectively while 2017 and 2019 had the largest area under low soil salinity covering 3092.97km2 and 2857.57km2 respectively. The changes in area under the different salinity levels were irregular over the years further indicating the dynamic nature of soil salinity. The mean salinity values for the nine years and the individual land use classes were calculated. The mean salinity values ranged from 0.1967 – 0.2275 indicating the mean salinity level was moderate. Herbaceous vegetation and cultivated land had the highest mean salinity values of 0.2639 and 0.2628 while water bodies and wetlands had the lowest mean salinity values of 0.0297 and 0.1544 respectively. For verification salinity maps from KALRO were utilized. The Jaccard coefficient was used to measure similarity between the raster datasets for the individual years against the secondary data from KALRO. Given the presence of salinity and its dynamic growth trends there needs to be urgent reclamation and rehabilitation efforts. Such include; better drainage to leach the soluble salts use of mulches to conserve water in agricultural land seed treatment among others.</td>

              <td>Habitat Quality Mapping in the Maasai Mara Ecosystem </td>
              <td>Rangeland can be defined as an extensive land area that is majorly covered by grass woodland and herbs which is grazed by wild and livestock animals. Over the years the Maasai Mara ecosystem has faced various threats the major one being the conversion of rangeland areas to agricultural farms. This has led to reduction of habitat quality in the Maasai Mara ecosystem hence leading to the degradation of the key ecosystem. Using Landsat images from the year 1980 to 2020 with a 10-year epoch from various sensors i.e. Landsat 2 MSS (1976) Landsat 3 MSS (1980) Landsat 4 TM (1990) Landsat 5 ETM (2010) Landsat 7 ETM+(2000) and Landsat 8 OLI (2020). A Land Cover classification was carried out using different classes i.e. grassland woodland tree cover plantations built up areas and wetland. These land cover changes were tracked and the most prevalent changes were the consistent increase in bareland plantations and built-up areas. The increase in areas for plantations (1853.56 km2 for 19901232.38 km2 for 20003233 km2 for 2010 and 1963.69 km2 for 2020) bareland (220.69 km2 for 1980 303.88 km2 for 1990458 km2 for 2000 418.94 km2 for 2010 and 808.16 km2 for 2020) and built up areas(247.63 km2 for 2000 72.81 km2 for 2010 and 1164.36 km2 for 2020) lead to the degradation of the Maasai Mara ecosystem and using the InVEST model different threats were identified to the ecosystem and were used to come up with habitat quality maps. The threats identified were; the plantations (impact distance of 15 km and weight of 0.8) built up areas (impact distance of 25 km and weight of 1) roads (impact distance of 20 km and weight of 0.5) and rivers (impact distance of 15km and weight of 0.5). Also the sensitivity of each habitat was assigned values according to each threat factor i.e. for wetland (0.70.60.5 and 0.4) woodland (0.70.80.4 and 0.5) grassland (0.70.90.5 and 0.6) and tree cover (0.60.60.1 and 0.2) with the values respective to built up areas plantations roads and rivers. The quality maps produced had values ranging from 0 to 1. The mean habitat quality for 1980 is 0.87 1990 is 0.71 2000 is 0.72 2010 is 0.57 and 2020 is 0.56. The habitat quality values indicate a continuous decrease over the years which indicates a degradation. In conclusion the Maasai Mara ecosystem faces degradation and proper mitigation measures should be put in place for mitigation.</td>

              <td>Estimation of carbon stored in mangrove forests for the year 2011 using vegetation indices </td>
              <td>The carbon budget of the terrestrial biosphere has attracted special attention because carbon emissions in the atmosphere have increased drastically over the previous decade. Mangroves’ ecosystems are one of the ecosystems that play a key role in the carbon budget since they are globally important carbon stores. Remote sensing images have proved adequate to map mangroves’ parameters including biomass and carbon stored. Vegetation Indices (VIs) generated from remote sensing images are used to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) of mangroves. This study was carried out to evaluate the performance of two vegetation indices particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the new Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI) in estimating AGB in mangroves in Mombasa county. Linear regression analysis was used to model the relationship between MVI NDVI and field AGB calculated using allometric equations. The models obtained were used in generation of biomass and carbon maps. The NDVI index provided a more superior model since when tested it had R-squared of 0.7317. The MVI model proved to be a poor estimator of AGB and carbon since when tested against field carbon values R-squared of 0.0331 was obtained. The availability of accurate mangrove biomass and carbon stock maps is beneficial for carrying out various management activities and is also very important for the resilience of mangroves to changing environments.</td>

              <td>With the increase in the demand for energy due to economic growth electrical energy transmission has become a very important issue as well as electrical power generation. One of the most important problems in energy transmission is finding the best route in a very complex study area. To date many people from different disciplines have come together to find the best routes by manual methods like using paper maps and deciding which route is the least-cost path (LCP) to the destination point. Today it is known that in engineering problems and especially in path-finding or site-placing problems the Geographic Information System (GIS) is the most powerful tool. On the other handfinding the best route is a very complicated problem and many criteria should be considered including: slope landslide road/railway/pipeline crossing distances to roads national parks archaeological areas residential areas forests and river crossings. Multicriteria decision methods like the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) should be used to make the most accurate decisions. In this study the classical AHP and FAHP are used to weight criteria relevant to energy transmission line (ETL) routing. A multi-decision maker approach is used where professionals from different professional backgrounds were sampled. According to the criteria digital maps of the sample study area are edited weighted converted to raster-based format and combined using the Environmental Systems Research Institute’s ArcGIS Desktop 10 software. After generation of the weighted surface map the LCP tool is used to find the best route. The routes generated are then compared to determine which MCDA method produced the best route. The results of this study show that FAHP generated the best route. Finallya digital cadastral database was created using QGIS showing the affected parcels for the purposes of compensation. With this study time and cost encountered using manual methods will decrease in HVTL routing and other routing problems.This study also addresses the issue of stakeholder participation in the planning phase of HVTL which is not considered in the convenctional methods of transmission line routing.</td>

              <td>The success of vaccination programs depends largely on the mechanisms used in vaccine delivery. National immunization programs offer childhood vaccines through fixed and outreach services within the health system and often additional supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are undertaken to fill gaps and boost coverage. The Government of Kenya has made significant investments in improving immunization in the country to prevent diseases especially among children. Nevertheless the country is yet to achieve the expected 100% immunization coverage to reduce disease burden and preventable deaths. Whereas the main aim of this study is to predict measles vaccination coverage in western Kenya among children of the age between 12-23 months its purpose is to inform relevant National Health policies to improve immunization coverage A map showing predicted coverage at 1 × 1 km spatial resolution in four counties to identify areas that are under-vaccinated via each delivery method using Demographic and Health Surveys data. Geographically weighted regression was used to obtain the coefficients of each of the variables tested and the generalized linear model was used to select the most significant covariate. The coefficients of the most significant covariates were used in the prediction. The results of this study may be used for decision-making by the ministry of health to aid in vaccine distribution and identification of areas that require attention in vaccine administration. This study will be able to show the coverage extends to which the vaccination has been done in the western region of Kenya in terms of coverage. This will be vital for an organization working under vaccine programs such as Kenya expanded program in immunization to plan and schedule for vaccine programs.</td>

The objective of the study was to analyze landslide susceptibility landslide hazard and risk assessment where Landslide analysis involved identifying the susceptible zones and assessing the hazard vulnerability on the affected areas. To achieve this objective GIS-multi criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) technique was used for landslide hazard mapping and zonation. The integration of different data layers with different levels of uncertainty was applied to landslide susceptibility mapping for the Nandi County with eleven landslide causal factors namely; rainfall soil type soil drainages lithology land use land cover slope aspect curvature stream densities lineament and soil depth. Parameters were extracted from an associated spatial database then evaluated with respective factor weight and class weight assigned to each of the associated factors based on pairwise comparison. The landslide susceptibility maps were produced based on weighted overlay techniques including analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted average. Results shows that the followings factors are the major landslide conditioning and triggering factors; high rainfall steep slopes very clayey soils unconsolidated rocks slopes facing away from the sun convex curvature high stream and lineament density bare grounds and farms. In case of occurrence Southern part of Nandi County is the most vulnerable part whereas the Northern region is less vulnerable. An estimate of eight kilometers of road network and twenty eight health facilities are at risk. This study can serve as a base map for future landslide analysis in the area.</td>

This study presents the evaluation of the burn severity as a result of the fire intensity while seeking to assess the recovery of vegetation over time since fire occurrence. The study looked into determining the severity classes based on thresholds created from the spectral burn indices from Landsat 7 TM image collections. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) was used in highlighting the fire scars with its sensitivity to vegetation cover moisture content and soil characteristics. The difference in pre-fire NBR and post-fire NBR resulted to difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) which was used to determine fire severity. MODIS fire product MOD64A1 that has fire detection algorithm was used in validation of the burnt areas. Quality assessment was done on the product to eliminate pixels with water and non- burnt area. Pixels with 60% confidence level were chosen as the fire areas. The recovery across the heterogeneous vegetation was based on fire severity NBR values annual average precipitation and amount of organic carbon in soil after fire event. The recovery increased throughout the period of recovery with minimal disturbances.</td>

Yala wetland basin is experiencing numerous activities whose influence is not well established. The study assessed the spatio-temporal changes in land use patterns influencing the size of Yala wetland system. The specific objectives were to; identify the land use/land cover patterns analyse the trends and variation in size of Yala wetland between 1990 and 2019 explore hydrological droughts over Yala swamp using standardized stream flow index (SSI) and analyse the impact of land use land cover changes on Yala swamp. To achieve these objectives wetlands cover change and land use change were studied through a time series of Landsat satellite images representing the last 3 decades (1990 2000 2010 and 2019). Unsupervised image classification was undertaken using ERDAS Imagine 2014 program and ground truthing exercise derived at six classes (i.e. built-up cropland forest plantation wetland and bush). The spatio-temporal imagery analysis revealed that changes have taken place between 1990 and 2019 in the wetland. The results indicate a decrease in the wetland area in the past 29 years with the overall percentage change in the last two epochs of 2010 and 2019 of (208% 114%) for Agriculture (76% 50%) for Built up(-44% -30%) for Open Water(-6% -37%) for Swampy Area. For accuracy assessment the overall Kappa Index of Agreement was 77% (Kappa=0.77). Based on the study findings it is recommended that conservation and rehabilitation measures are required by planners and managers to save this wetland ecosystem otherwise this rate of change in the wetland area will lead to shrinkage and may get lost in due course.</td>

The objective of this study was to develop groundwater vulnerability assessment using multicriterial analysis. The study was also focused on the impacts of hydrogeological and geological parameters on groundwater nitrates change. Because Ruiru groundwater resource is important water supply for both domestic and industrial usage. This is very important in groundwater management and effective management from potential pollution. In this study the effectiveness of GIS techniques based on multicriteria decisionmaking Analytic Hierarchy Process which is a spatial detective tool was utilized in exploring groundwater potential risk to pollution. In the analysis six hydrogeological features were considered as influencing pollution factors; depth of aquifer aquifermedia recharge rate soil topography of the slope infiltration rate.The weights of these criteria were developed through Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The major findings of this study were groundwater potential risk zones where high groundwater risk was observed in the central part of the study area which lies within Murera Ruirutown and Kahawa Sukari while the low risk areas were observed in the northern part of the study area and west part of Kahawa sukari. Regression analysis between groundwater nitrates done in R studio show areas with higher groundwater risk of pollution were seen having a high nitrate chemical in the groundwater. On the other hand poor chemical was in the areas with less risks. Finally there is a significant relationship between the groundwater quality and the landcover of the study area. Area of settlements have a higher level of pollution risk.</td>

                <td>Desert locusts are short-horned grasshoppers from the Acrididae family. They are said to be among the most dangerous pests as a result of their ability to migrate from one place to another at approximately 200 Km a day have a high reproductive rate create large swarm sizes and are able to consume foods equivalent to their weight in a day. The desert locusts are said to be difficult to control hence studying about their feeding and breeding patterns is important in order to manage them effectively. In order to achieve this the spatial extent of the infestation can be determined by creating infestation maps determining areas that are potential for their breeding and development of the eggs that they have laid and studying their migration patterns. The main aim of this research was to conduct a study on locust monitoring and impact assessment of the infestation in Turkana County being one of the county’s most affected by the infestation based on reports made by FAO. The methodology used in this study was creating an infestation map from the NDVI difference map calculated from the Sentinel 2 imageries that were taken before and after infestation. The resulting image was then categorized into 5 classes to show severity of the infestation. Quantification of the impacts of infestation was conducted using landcover maps that were created by applying supervised classification using ArcGIS software .Accuracy assessment was also conducted . In addition  a comparative study of the NDVI values between images of Turkana before and after infestation was done in order to ascertain whether the infestation that occurred was indeed due to the locusts using actual ground coordinates where infestation was reported to have occured. Random forest algorithm was used in the modelling of potential breeding and egg development sites using factors that favor breeding and egg development. These factors are: soil moisture soil PH temperature sandy soil and rainfall. The results of the infestation map showed that the western and southern part of Turkana county were severely infested . The landcover maps used for the quantification of the impacts of this infestation showed a decrease in savanna cropland and forest cover while shrubs and baregrounds increased significantly during the infestation period. Moreover the comparison of the NDVI images before and after infestation showed that NDVI before infestation was higher than NDVI after infestation at the specific areas where infestation was reported . An accuracy of 80% was achieved in modelling of the potential breeding and egg development sites using the random forest algorithm where the top most northern part of Turkana areas near Lake Turkana and most Eastern parts of Turkana provided suitable breeding and egg development sites.</td>

With diminishing parking spaces and increase in the number of vehicles demand to access to real time information by motorists has been on the rise. The aim of this study is to develop a web based GIS parking management system that allows drivers to access parking information about the vacant parking spaces reserve and monitor their parking sessions and also provision information on the shortest route of accessing the reserved parking space. In addition the system provides a platform for the authorities concerned to monitor and manage the parking spaces. Forty parking spaces both on-street and off-street parking spaces were collected within Nairobi City CBD and stored into a postgreSQL database. A backend server was developed using Python - Geodjango web framework to link the database and the client web server. Mobile money payment was integrated to enable motorists to pay for their reservation using Mpesa thus eliminating the need of parking attendants. Furthermore the systems employs SMS notification to alert the users on their parking status. A web platform was developed using HTML CSS and React JS. It provided users with an interface to interact with the system. Available parking slots are displayed on map for users to view and also the route to access the reserved parking space. In addition users can monitor the remaining time of their reservation time on the platform. The system changes the paradigm of a fixed parking fee mode in the current system and rather charges the parking fee based on the duration of reservation. This dynamism provides fairness in the amount of parking fee charged as a person parking for thirty minutes doesn’t pay the same as a person parking for twelve hours. The system eliminates the trial and error and emotional stress involved in locating a parking spaces.</td>

The flood risk vulnerability mapping follows a multi-parametric approach and integrates some of the flooding causative factors such as rainfall distribution elevation and slope drainage network and density land-use/land-cover and soil type. From the vulnerability mapping urban flood risk index (UFRI) for the case study area which is determined by the degree of vulnerability and exposure is also derived. The results are validated using flood depth measurements with a minimum average difference of 0.01m and a maximum average difference of 0.37 m in depth of observed flooding in the different flood prone areas. Similarly with respect to area extents a maximum error of not more than 8% was observed in the highly vulnerable flood zones. In addition the Consistency Ratio which shows an acceptable level of 0.09 was calculated and further validated the strength of the proposed approach.</td>

Globally reservoirs lose their storage capacity due to sedimentation at the rate of 2% annually the reservoirs at the upper Tana catchment area lose their storage capacity to sedimentation at the rate of 1% annually. This study aimed at simulating sediment yield in the upper Tana catchment using the Soil and Water assessment tool (SWAT) through the following; i.) deriving the hydrological response units ii.) estimating the sediment yield by running the swat model for a period of 28 years and iii.) calibrating and validating the sediment yield output using SWAT_CUP SUFI2 algorithm. Swat model was first run to derive the hydrological response units which are the response units of the catchment and have an effect on sediment and flow using the digital elevation model to first delineate the watershed and the land use/landcover and soil maps to derive the HRUs the weather data was also input and the SWAT model run to get estimated amount of sediment yield every year. The output was later calibrated and validated using observed data from 1991-2000. Results from this study showed that; i) high sediment yield data was in the year 2019 as 383276.2 million cm3 and low sediment yield was from the year 1988 as 600.967million cm3  ii) the year with the highest derived hydrological response units was 2018 and the lowest year was 1988 iii) the calibrated and validated NSE objective function value was 0.82 indicating the model was a good tool to estimate sediment yield and iv) the average annual sediment yield yearly was found to be 0.041tonnes. The information could be used to come up with mitigation soil conservation measures such as afforestation in areas highly affected by soil erosion in order to curb sedimentation.</td>

                <td>The sustainable management of water distribution networks is a crucial challenge especially in emerging countries. The distribution networks have very low efficiency with very high levels of leaks. Locating and prioritizing of water leakage areas becomes the main concern for public services to optimize the use of resources and improve constancy of supply. Water distribution systems are designed with the objective of minimizing the overall cost while meeting the water demand requirements at adequate pressures. However during operations of water supply systems cases of pressure drops Leakages and contamination occur and the main challenge is the lack of a simple tool to accurately predict zones of low pressures and areas more prone to pipe leakages. A water supply system is a system of engineered hydrologic and hydraulic components which provide water supply for domestic use industrial purposes fire fighting and so on. This project mainly focused on creating a database to store data on all the components of the distribution system linking it to a hydraulic software using the model building tools e.g Model Builder Trex LoadBuilder which was validated and run to obtain the pressures at the different nodes and flow rate(velocities) in the pipes. The simulation results in csv were later encoded into appropriate data layers as additional fields using the join tools in GIS software. The Various factors associated with pipe leakages such as pressure velocity results from the hydraulic simulation together with pipe materials Slope traffic load and previous history leakage areas were analyzed reclassified ranked and weighted in order to come up with zones most prone to leakages in the network upon which the output was converted to a Geojson file format which was used to create a heat map showing areas in the northern part of the study area being prone than other areas within Kasarani. The web application allowed restriction to authenticated users only and allowed the system manager to add delete and update leaks within the interactive interface allowing for additional information on the type of issue to be addressed asset the attention required and leak assignments to field workers be more efficient and synchronized. The application was hosted locally using a WAMP server. It was concluded that the application was an efficient and organized way of maintaining leaks and reducing money lost through UFW.</td>

Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nations carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which requires information on forest clearing and carbon storage. Thus the main objective of this study is to adequately quantify the amount of carbon stock in the Aberdare Forest Reserve in Nyeri County Central Kenya. Interferometric coherence and backscatter intensities from Sentinel-1 were used to quantify above ground carbon. Random Forest and Support Vector Regression were used in establishing a relationship between fields measured values and remotely sensed parameters. Using Random Forest model showed the best results with an R2 of 0.85 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 335 tons/ha. Support Vector Regression did not perform well with R2 of 0.15 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 542 tons/ha. Carbon stock maps were produced for the study area. These maps show carbon distribution and can be used for more precise carbon modelling. The maps are used in forest monitoring or risk managing systems under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation forest degradation and the role of conservation sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) protecting forests and analyzing carbon release. This study shows that Sentinel series satellite data and machine learning algorithms has exceptional capabilities in estimating dense forest AGC.</td>

                <td>The use of fossil fuel has negative impacts on the environment such as greenhouse gas emissions global warming and climate change. Biomass has been recognized as an alternative source of energy because it is renewable cheaper readily available and CO2 neutral. Maize residue can be used as an alternative source of energy. The aim of this study was to estimate the energy potential of maize residue in ADC (Agricultural Development Corporation) farms in Trans Nzoia county. The maize residue cover was estimated using Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) calculated on Sentinel-2 imagery. NDTI makes use of the shortwave infrared bands of Sentinel-2 to identify crop residue. The maize residue cover obtained from NDTI was less than 30% of the total area in the Agricultural Development Corporation farms. This could have attributed to continuous tillage. There were varying results for the maize residue cover and this could be attributed to the varying moisture conditions which affect NDTI. The energy potential of the maize residue was then calculated from the dry biomass in the farms and the lower heating values of the maize cobs and the maize stalks. This was done for all five ADC farms. The energy potential of the maize residue was found to be high. Finally the potential sites for biomass plants were identified using multi-criteria analysis in ArcGIS. The factors that affect the location of biomass plant site were chosen based on literature. The constraints such as forests protected areas and water bodies were buffered and the criteria chosen were summed up and multiplied by the constraints to get the most suitable locations for a biomass plant. From the results it was evident that the accessibility as well as the availability of the feedstock contributed a great deal to the location of the bioenergy plants. It was concluded that the use of spectral indices such as NDTI can be used to estimate maize residue cover and the results can be improved by considering other indices such us shortwave infrared residue index which is not affected by varying moisture conditions. It is of importance to note that the actual amount of maize residue that can be utilized for energy generation needs to be known prior to computation of the energy potential. This is because some of the residue needs to be left behind to protect the soil from loss of nutrients and soil erosion.</td>

Arid and semi-arid areas are the worst hit regions by water scarcity. Urban population growth in Kenya is continuously increasing putting pressure on the existing water resources. Poor management of these scarce water resources has made the situation worse in Kenya. This study sought to find a way to distribute the available scarce water to the consumers in an effective way. This ensures that there is equality in water distribution to the various consumers in an urban area. The study area was Kitui Town. This study considers the water demand and water supply amounts of the area. The total water demand is first calculated optimization is carried out and a water rationing schedule is generated. The residential water demand is estimated using three machine learning regression techniques; Random Forest (RF) Neural Network (NN) and SVR(Support Vector Regression) regression techniques. These techniques were compared using Mean Absolute Error Root Mean Square Error and R2. The variables considered were population density residential density income levels and number of households. Optimization was carried out using NSGA – II a genetic algorithm with the aim of maximizing supply and minimizing water supply deficit to the various areas in Kitui town. Water consumption patterns were considered when coming up with the water rationing schedule. SVR was seen to perform the best in modelling water demand with a MAE of 7.62126 RMSE of 15.77499 and R2 of 0.7834985. Residential water demand estimation was carried out for the months of November 2019 December 2019 and January 2020. The monthly water demand for Kitui town was found to be 53082.7055m3 54531.2498m3 and 52461.372m3 respectively. The water supply amounts to Kitui town for the month of November 2019 was 29303m3 December 2019 was 30732m3 and January 2020 was 27744m3.The water demand was found to be greater than the water available for distribution. Optimization was found to be able to ensure equality in the distribution of the available limited water resource.</td>

The findings from the DinSAR showed that within the island the deformation rate had increased by 1.8 mm from the earlier stated earlier 0.42mm while unreported subsidence of up to 1.5cm and uplifts of up to 2cm were seen within Likoni and Changamwe areas. From the regression results the rock type was found to be the most significant factor followed by soil loss and land use. The results of the geographically weighted regression were fair reporting an R2 value of 0.501 indicating that there could be a need to consider more factors in order to model the mapped deformation completely. The research was able to detect previously unreported deformation patterns in the area while the significant factors were also studied.</td>

                <td>Prioritizing rural roads infrastructure is one of the major problems faced by road agencies. Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KERRA) and other agencies usually have many road projects to select from. Due to pressure on resources and public demand for a transparent and consistent prioritization process a scientific methodology of identifying deserving roads is needed. This research focuses on using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and other spatial techniques to calculate rural accessibility index which shows the percentage of people that live more than 25 minutes of walking distance away from an all season road. From this index the agencies can prioritize ranking roads in these areas deserving improvement. This research also seeks to automate the process of prioritization of roads for improvement to save time wasted by stakeholders in the roads industry. The criteria that was evaluated by this study included: Surface condition Index accessibility offered to health services accessibility offered to education services growth centers served by the road and the population served by the road. The results shown that the average percentage of people with access to good roads in Meru county is about 82% and Accessibility to health services was the most important criteria in the prioritization process. The results also show that collector roads near peri-urban areas had the highest priority score as they served more services compared to low volume seasonal roads. This research also demonstrated that GIS can successfully be used in prioritization of low volume earth roads and give the road most deserving to be improved. The results of this study are crucial to road agencies such as KeRRA Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) and Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) as they can be used in achieving balanced infrastructural development throughout the country as the country strives to achieve vision 2030 and meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) goal 9 in particular which emphasises investment in infrastructure and innovation as a crucial driver of economic growth.</td>

                <td>Aridity is defined as lack of moisture and temporary reduction rainfall in an area. In the recent years significant parts of lower eastern Kenya (Machakos Makueni and Kitui) have been suffering from severe aridity. This calls for a regional study of aridity using appropriate aridity indices. These aridity indices provide prime variable in monitoring and assessing the impact of aridity and its characterization based on intensity duration severity and spatial extent. Objectives of this study were to characterize aridity using De Martonne and Pinna Combinative indices and to analyse the spatial-temporal patterns of the study area. The datasets used were CHIRPS rainfall and CRU temperature downloaded from CHIRPS and CRU websites respectively from 1981 to 2019. Monthly values of IDM and IP were calculated and normalized. PCA was employed for the spatial-temporal decomposition of the normalized IDM and IP values. The trends were identified using the Man-Kendall test and Sen’s slope and the correlation between IDM and IP was identified using correlation mathematical method. IDM and IP spatial maps and temporal graphs were generated from the spatial decomposition of the IDM and IP values. According to IDM arid semi-arid and mediterranean conditions were predominant covering about 70% of the study area while about 80% of the study area was classified as dry and semi-dry mediterranean based on IP. The most vulnerable to aridity were the regions to the north of the study area especially Kitui County. Arid and semi-arid conditions were found across the study area especially the central and northern parts and occupied most parts of Machakos and Kitui Counties. The southern region of the study area was categorized as semi-humid and humid predominant in Makueni County. The temporal patterns showed 1982 1983 1987 1988 1997 1998 2015 and 2018 years had the highest extremes attributed to El Nino whereas 1984 1985 1989 1999 2000 2010 2011 and 2016 years had the lowest extremes attributed to La Nina. The trend analysis results showed that the aridity trend was less significant ence gradual increase in aridity across the study area. The two indices (IDM and IP) were highly correlated (0.9999887) displaying similar spatial patterns and therefore they were preferred as they discriminated different climatic conditions in the study area. The results of the present study would be useful in future planning evaluating and managing water resources in order to control land degradation and desertification by taking the necessary precautions.</td>

                <td>Agricultural drought is one of the most critical hazards requiring redress with respect to intensity magnitude frequency and effect on people’s livelihoods. This is particularly true for Kenya where up to 70% of the population relies on agricultural activities and where food insecurity as a result of drought affected an estimated 3 million people in 2019 alone. This thesis explored the applicability of the new Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI) to detect agricultural droughts in Kenya and compared its efficacy against a well-known precipitation-based index; the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index is a relatively new index that  utilizes satellite-based data on soil moisture surface temperature and vegetation greenness to capture the hydric stress on the soil-vegetation ensemble. The thesis characterized the spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural droughts in Kenyan Arid and Semi-Arid regions from 2003 to 2020 with both indices. It proceeded to evaluate how well the indices performed in capturing droughts with reference to vegetation data. Results showed that spatially agricultural droughts spread outward with intensity from around Isiolo county towards the rest of the country for the 17-year period. Second temporal patterns identified the years 2005 2006 2009 2011 and 2019 as record dry years while years 2004 2007 2012 and 2018 featured as wet ones. Third SPI showed a slightly better correlation with vegetation cover than the SMADI index with an r-value of 0.633 against -0.561. Overall SMADI was able to detect the duration of most droughts far better than SPI while SPI showed a quicker response to drought onset. Based on these findings the study suggests a complementary use of the two indices for improved agricultural drought detection and monitoring.</td>

Recent past strange perennial climatic events complications such as increased sea/land temperatures excessive downpours severe drought have been more often in coastal counties despite located along shore of Indian ocean. The occurrence of these events pose a great challenge to the economy and environment. Coastal region is home of millions of people due to its attractive weather and environment by local and international tourists although it’s prone to drought cases now and then. The study aimed at (i) analyzing the spatio-temporal characteristics of extreme climatic events using 3 6 12-month standard precipitation index from 1982-2018 (ii) analyzing the association of climatic indices (ENSO and IOD ) with extreme events in Coastal Region. The temporal drought pattern results showed years 1982 1986 1990 1994 1996-97 2003 2007 2011 2016-18 to be extremely dry while years 1982 1990 1993 1997 2004 2006 20102017 were extremely wet based on SPI and PCA analysis. Additionally from spatial patterns drought was prominent by covering approximately 75% of the study area. Most vulnerable counties were Tana river Kwale Mombasa Taita taveta compared to Lamu and Kilifi. Spearman correlation method was used where association values of IOD event were weak mostly negative correlated with extreme events in the region as compare to ENSO events. A weak association range from -0.22 to +0.25 with ENSO was found while IOD ranged from -0.35 to +0.23 a weak association.

Both datasets were extracted for every grid point within the basin. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the 3-month gridded SPEI data of the entire basin and was used to assess the temporal and spatial patterns of dry and wet events i.e. to characterize the Meteorological Drought. This was then followed by the determination of dry/wet trends using the Mann Kendall Trend Test and subsequently the frequency of occurrence identified using Fourier Transforms. The PCA showed that there were two leading components which explained over 89.8% of the spatial variation of dry and wet events in the basin. Meteorological drought on characterization was found to be spatially dominant and mainly affect the central region of the study basin as displayed by the first PC loadings map. Temporal analysis showed dry events dominated the period between 1988 and 2006 while wet events were dominant in the period between 2006 and 2018. This was also true in the wet/dry trend test in that 1988 to 2006 showed an upward trend in dry periods and a downward trend in the dry period from 2006 to 2018. Cycles of drought i.e. mild moderate and severe were observed in three dominant cycles of 1.3 2.5 and 3.3 years respectively. Overall this study provides evidence that meteorological drought does occur in areas that are regarded by most as high rainfall yielding areas such as the Nzoia Basin. This information is of high value for setting up adaptation and mitigation strategies related to forest conservation farming and natural resources preservation.</td>

                <td>Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in Kenya today. Trans-Nzoia has large areas under large-scale farming. The reported maize yield levels have been declining over the years in the county. Trans-Nzoia is a maize basket in Kenya; hence the decline is alarming since it can lead to food shortages. Early yield estimation of maize grain is important for planning and policy decisions. Many countries including Kenya use the conventional techniques of data collection for maize crop monitoring and yield estimation which are based on ground-based visits and reports. These methods are very costly and time consuming. With the launch of satellites satellite data is now being used. The satellite-based approaches are less expensive save time; data acquisition covers large areas and can be used to estimate maize grain yields before harvest. The study uses support vector regression as the global regression model and the geographically weighted regression as the local regression model. Local regression models consider the spatial variability of various variables while global models do not consider that the variables can vary spatially. The aim of this study is therefore to estimate yield using the local and global regression models to determine whether considering the spatial heterogeneity of variables is necessary. The data used was the historical maize-yield between the years 2017-2019 satellite-derived NDVI temperature precipitation and the area under cultivation. The zonal statistic tool was used to calculate the NDVI precipitation and temperature values for each farm based on the values from the raster datasets. In the study the GWR model performed better with an R2 of 0.9432 0.8962 and 0.9491 in the years 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively and the SVM with an R2 of 0.5475 0.8328 and 0.9239 in the years 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively. This findings show that considering the spatial variability of various variables when estimating yield is necessary.</td>

Earth dams have particularly become popular in the country since they are cheap use local material have a straight forward design and can be adapted in areas where a concrete dam is not suitable. They however have the highest probability to fail that would lead to loss of life destruction of property and degradation of the environment. A recent example in Kenya is the breaking of Milmet dam Solai in 2018 reported to kill over 48 people. Hydrodynamic studies have been conducted to simulate dam breaks but they involve extensive and expensive studies which leads to untimely information. Incorporation of GIS and Remote Sensing methods in computer models like HEC-RAS have made these studies faster and cheaper. Performing these simulations require assessment of breach parameters that are obtained from regression equations developed from past dam break occurrences. It is however difficult to assess which equation is best suited for a particular study area. The objective of this study is to simulate Milmet flood occurrence from breach parameters obtained from regression equations developed by MacDonald and Langridge-Monopolis Froehlich 1995 Froehlich 2008 Von Thun & Gillette and Xu & Zhang to compare it to the actual mapped flood. The breach parameters obtained from each of the regression equations were combined with a DEM LULC and precipitation data to perform a simulation. They were compared to the actual flood and it was observed that the Von Thun & Gillette equation produced the highest accuracy. This equation was then used to determine the breach parameters if the Tindires dam in Nakuru was to fail. It generated a flood simulation from which maps were developed to show the flood extent and depth of flood that would reach certain areas. This study gives a guideline to which equation is best suited for prediction of homogenous clay filled dams to help create inundation maps to assess the downstream risk areas prepare evacuation plans and design protection measures.</td>

This improves land conveyance and reduces land record duplication. It also reduces the procedures of obtaining parcel related information eradicate the need for the over the counter procedure and department bureaucracy. Applying of GIS technology in the Kakamega Registry would be a suitable solution provided that its advantages and shortcomings are well understood.

              <td>Bilharzia is vector-borne disease carried by a parasite that is hosted by fresh water snails. The distribution of the disease is concurrent with the existence of the freshwater snails and dependent on certain suitable environmental conditions. Areas in Kenya with high cases of bilharzia also have high numbers of the freshwater snails. It is difficult to identify the specific habitats of the snails as they are difficult to access on the ground the snails also migrate by means of flowing water making it difficult to keep a track of the freshwater snails. This paper aimed at using GIS Remote Sensing and Species Distribution Modelling techniques to model the suitable habitats for the freshwater snails and to prove that the snails migrate when there are sudden changes in water levels whilst showing the population at risk of bilharzia. The SDM used is the Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) for its ability to make right predictions even with presences of around 10 sites. The AUC value of the model was 0.951. The research results showed that the environmental variables; brightness Index elevation temperatures were negatively correlated with the snails’ presence while the wetness index MSAVI greenness index and soil Ph were positively correlated. The snails are observed to favor clay soils of the montmorillonite type and the crop-lands land cover. As suspected the areas consistently submerged by water are shown to be the most suitable areas where snails migrate by means of river or canal water. The research would further recommend that the MaxEnt Model can be developed to make it possible for one to easily extract the equation of prediction which can then be used in other areas to model the habitats for the snails. One can also investigate the damage on the rice caused by the snails and then map it or economically represent it by change detection tactics. The neighboring sub-counties within Kirinyaga County should be investigated using such models as a likely source-habitat of the freshwater snails. Destroying the source habitats will lead to complete eradication of the freshwater snails within Mwea.</td>

This can further be compounded by the occurrence of land subsidence resulting from the land instability. The Mutonga area is prone to ground deformation subsidence and land degradation. This study aims at analyzing the rate of land degradation the rate of soil loss and explore the correlation between the two phenomena. Sentinel-1 SLC images were used to create interferograms through Differential interferometric methods after which vertical displacement measurements between the years 2014 and 2020 were generated. The rate of soil loss was analyzed using the RUSLE Model and their relationship explored using GWR. The study showed that the displacements were negative implying a subsidence. The land degradation rates from the RUSLE model illustrated that the area is prone to erosion. The most influential RUSLE factors were the LS factor and the K factor while the least influential factor was the R factor. Using GWR the relationship between the ground deformation and the land degradation were analyzed showing that they were highly correlated between 93% and 96%. An increase in vertical displacement led to a corresponding increase in the soil loss rates.</td>

Turkana County is adversely affected by drought and famine as well as floods. The study involved the determination of areas in Turkana with relatively high agricultural potential flooding hotspots and eventually the identification of optimal points of water collection suitable for establishment of water reticulation system for irrigation. This study employed GIS tools and methods such as the GIS hydrological tool (H &amp; H Modelling) in ArcGIS to model the floodplains and weighted overlay analysis overlaying soil data land use/land cover data temperature NDVI precipitation and water well distribution to determine the optimal sites for agriculture. Also the digital elevation model (DEM) was generated for the region and was processed for the fill and sink using ArcGIS Hydro tool. Results of this study show that 2.5 million Ha of land (36.4%) has agricultural potential with 1.029 million Ha (41.2% of the land with agricultural potential and 15.4% of the total land) ideal for flood-based spate irrigation. Spate irrigation is the diversion of flood flows from seasonal rivers to fields by means of small dams gabions and canals. The water is then used in the farmlands for farming of maize millet and sorghum in the identified zones as they are bound to thrive there.</td>

              <td>Galana Kulalu is located in a semi-arid region where rain-fed agriculture cannot be practiced. Therefore it is essential to properly manage the amount of water tapped from the Galana and Tana rivers since they are the only water sources used for irrigation in the scheme. The potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the Food and Agricultural Organization 56 paper documentation that recommends initial estimation of reference evapotranspiration and the computation of crop coefficients. The maize crop coefficients obtained from this research are 0.48 1.06 and 0.58 for the seeding &elongation booting & heading and the milk-done & mature stages respectively while the theoretical values of maize crop coefficients are 0.3 1.2 and 0.6. This variation is explained by the fact that theoretical values are a generalization of the maize crop coefficients in different climatic conditions. Hargreaves equation was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration. The study results showed that the potential evapotranspiration ranged between 63.6-74.4mm/day 99.7-121.8 mm/day and 68.3-73.6mm/day for May June and July respectively while the theoretical values of the potential evapotranspiration of maize range between 67.8-76.4mm/day for the seeding &elongation stage 100.7-138.3mm/day for the booting & heading stage and 70.7-75.3 for the milk-done & mature stage. The optimal water requirements ranged between 687-739m3/ha 711-818m3 /ha and 634-697m3/ha respectively indicating that maize had the highest water demand in the booting & heading stage while the seeding & elongation stage had lower water demand compared to the milk-done & mature stage. The optimal water requirements for maize grown in arid and semi-arid regions range between 657-723m3/ha 690-802m3/ha and 612-685m3/ha for the seeding &elongation booting & heading and the milk-done & mature stages respectively. The water deficit ratio was 50.1-63.8% in May 57.5-66.2% in June and 46.9-53.4% in July indicating that the booting & heading stage requires relatively more irrigation water than both the booting & heading and the milk-done & mature stages. The actual water needs indicate that the maize was overwatered by 8m3/ha in average in May and underwatered by 11m3/ha and 6m3/ha in average in June and July respectively</td>

              <td>Water is a natural resource which is very important for human existence and sustainability of a conducive environment. Its availability varies with geographical area time and quality leading to water scarcity which can be attributed to continuous population growth urbanization industrialization and agricultural development. These factors have led to an increase in water demand against the limited supply hence overexploitation of existing water sources to meet their needs. Therefore there is need to harvest and store water for future use. The study’s main goal was to estimate the amount of rainwater harvestable by rooftops and its storage for future use. This was achieved by extracting rooftops using objected-oriented image classification method which employed different techniques of feature detection and extraction. A tool for automating the Rooftop Extraction process was also developed. The rooftops area sizes and rainfall variations were determined and used in estimating the potential harvestable rainwater. The amount was assessed against the demand to determine the extent in which it would meet the deficit. A total of 1847 rooftops with a coverage of 312334 m2 were extracted with 94.5% correctness and 51.3% completeness. The potential harvestable rainwater was estimated at 383138 m3 over a uniform rainfall distribution with a total storage capacity requirement of 316659 m3. The households were later classified into low medium and high storage capacities. The harvestable water was found meet 55.65% of the town’s water demand hence a significant amount in catering for the growing population.</td>

              <td>Hydro power is currently the major renewable source of energy contributing significantly to the total electricity supply in Kenya. Currently 45.3 % of Kenya’s electric power is supplied by hydro power. This accounts for 818 MW. The main sources of hydro power in Kenya are the seven forks dams located in the upper Tana river basin in central Kenya. Hydro power largely depends on river discharge which hugely depend on precipitation. The global climatic variability in precipitation and temperature could alter the hydrologic condition of the basin and hence affect hydro power generation. This research project therefore aims to assess the impacts of climate variability on hydro power generation in Kenya focusing on the Seven Forks dams in the upper Tana river basin. First a 30-year climatic data; precipitation and temperature trends will be analyzed since 1990 to 2019. This would then be linked to the basin hydrology and changes in the Tana river discharge over the same period of time. Finally river discharge will be linked to the hydro power generation assuming that a reduction in discharge will cause a decrease in power outputs. Similarly it assumes that an increase in river discharge will cause an increase in power outputs to a maximum of the installed capacity of each hydro station. Results show that there is a strong correlation between precipitation trends stream flow and hydropower generation within the seven forks dams. An increase in rainfall causes an increase in river discharge and in turn an increase in power outputs from the seven forks dams. However the general HEP outputs show a negative trend as a result of the sporadic nature of precipitation and discharge and the increasing temperatures over the past three decades. Unless sound policies and mitigation measures are put in place to cushion these resources future HEP outputs will reduce.</td>

              <td>Mount Longonot is one of the Quaternary volcanoes of the world situated in the floors of Rift Valley of Kenya. It has taken over 200 years since the last eruption. This may have led to view that the eruption might not be possible again but instead the volcano is just sleeping. Over the previous years there are various developments taking around the place without considering what might happen in case an eruption occurs. This research mainly aims at using Remote sensing and GIS together with probabilistic models to assess hazard in case of the eruption within the radius of 15km. The model used in this research is the Energy cone model. EC model was chosen because of (1) it is simple model capable of dealing with large high damaging dilute PDCs and (2) the main output variable is the maximum distance (run out) reached by the various flows which is the main parameter considered for the hazard assessment. The results from the model can be overlayed with those obtained from vulnerability assessments and exposure assessment to obtain risk map in case of volcanic eruption on Mount Longonot. From the risk assessment mapping it was concluded that the most dangerous area is withing the 5km distance from the Mountain as it will be associated with hot volcanic materials and according to Smithsonian website this area has a population of 809 and thus the study will assist in case of volcanic eruption in the evacuation process</td>

Remote sensing and GIS are essential tools in detection of fishing grounds which is important in providing fish sustainability for human being. This recent tool allows fishing grounds detection at minimal cost and optimizes effort. This research tends to identify the most favourable both environmentally and ecologically satisfactory factors which favours fish breeding and growth. Landsat 8 derived satellite data of Chl-a and lake surface temperature (LST) and fisheries catch data were analyzed using suitability index (SI) in Lake Victoria. Distribution of fish was associated with preferred range. Potential fishing ground maps derived from the SI. This project attempts to justify the application of satellite imagery as a tool to identify map and forecast the parameters which are linked to fish presence in aquatic environments. The study concentrated on establishing suitability ratings in different parts of Lake Victoria using lake surface temperature and chlorophyll-a levels. The study was conducted for months; January May and December 2019 on Lake Victoria. The output obtained illustrated the availability of suitable and habitable zones within the lake using satellite imagery and the suitability index. The fish catch data and satellite derived variables are used to determine habitat suitability indices for fish during January May and December 2019. More than 90% of the total catch was found to come from the areas with sea surface temperature of 23.0°–28.3°C and chlorophyll-a concentration 0.72–1.31 mg/m3 and the catch data was used to validate the images. This study indicated the capability of HSI as a tool to map the potential fishing grounds of fish species in Lake Victoria. The potential fishing zone maps will help the fishers and fishery management to identify the extract zones in lake and manage resources.</td>

              <td>Kenyan wetlands especially natural wetlands have undergone numerous modifications due to different competitions for water and other land resources for agricultural activities. To ensure conservation and protection of these useful resources provided by the wetlands it is necessary to map and monitor wetlands including their accompanying landscape features. It is also important to predict the environmental impacts of these modifications to the wetlands and their environments. Various spatial sciences such as Remote Sensing and GIS have shown great potential in monitoring the wetland changes for huge areas. In this study Remote sensing technology was applied whereby four Landsat images Landsat 4 TM (1988) Landsat 7 ETM+ (1999) Landsat 5 TM (2009) and Landsat 8 OLI (2019) were used to monitor the Landscape dynamics within the study area. Further two indices NDWI and NDVI were used to identify areas susceptible to wetland depletion and later regression analysis was carried out to predict future environmental impacts in the wetland. Results obtained indicated that various Landscapes in the study area have undergone changes in the past three decades. For instance open Grassland and swamp which are the main wetland features experienced drastic changes. Open Grassland decreased by about 13% (4.057 km2) then increased by 30% (13.532km2) and then decreased by 17% (6.578 km2) respectively between 1988 and 2019. Swamp also experienced decrease in area coverage by around 1% (1.018 km2) 35% (31.300 km2) and 97% (43.665 km2). For the period 1988 to 2019 the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) showed a change with a small improvement and decrease trend respectively. In conclusion Remote sensing technology was regarded as the best method that can be used to map monitor and predict future changes on the wetlands. It was recommended that the government in collaboration with concerned organizations should incorporate Remote sensing and GIS techniques in management and conservation of wetlands</td>

Land related feuds contribute to injuries loss of lives loss of property and hinder the smooth implementation of activities necessary to support the economic development of a country. Land conflicts are a serious threat to the realization of the country’s Vision 2030 in general and the “Big Four” Agenda of food security accessible and affordable housing universal healthcare and manufacturing. Therefore issues in land ought to be handled with utmost care since land is a primary resource that people depend on for their livelihood and socio-economic growth and development. It is on this basis that this study is meant to investigate the spatial pattern of land disputes and the impacts such disputes affect human capital and infrastructural development. Areas that could be regarded as hotspots of land disputes were outlined using GIS techniques to enable more concentrated efforts and focus by policy makers. Understanding the specific nature of land disputes and their spatial distribution is a vital step in knowing the effects on the growth and development of the affected area. Conflicts in land are a serious threat to the security and the general development of an area. Areas with land related disputes generally experience retarded growth due to adverse effects of land disputes on investment. Therefore addressing the problem using evidence-based interventions is urgently needed. The findings of the study will contribute to the knowledge of understanding the spatial distribution of land disputes in Juja Sub-County and the effects of such disputes to the socio-economic growth and development. The study will also provide opportunity to decision and policy formulators to evaluate previous legislations and improve on any weaknesses identified to come up with better working policies in resolving land disputes.</td>

              <td>The studys primary aim was to understand how land use land cover changes over the period of years has contributed to flooding in the Tana river basin. This was achieved by using GIS and Remote Sensing techniques to estimate runoff and sediment yield by accounting for effects of Land use/Land cover changes and soil loss on flood risk. Landsat image for the years 2000 2010 and 2018 was used to map the study areas cover changes. Using Supervised classification the images were classified into Water bare lands vegetation forest and built-up areas and also change detection was carried out. Revised Universal Soil Loss equation (RUSLE) was used in the modelling of soil erosion with the consideration of slope length and steepness (LS) rainfall erosivity (R) soil erodibility (K) and the support practice (P) factors. In the 2000 erosion map the severity of erosion occurring was mostly in the highlands with its value being 0.163966 and the lowest value being -0.000265453 and in the 2010 erosion map the severity of erosion occurring increased with its value being 0.360685 and the lowest value being 1.42812e-006. The severity of erosion occurring in the 2018 erosion map increased with its value being 0.519634 and the lowest value being 3.31745e-006. There was a gradual increase in erosion from 2000 to 2018. Runoff and sediment yield estimation was achieved using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and used to assess the effects of land-use change on both streamflow and sediment loading on flooding. The average annual watershed surface runoff for the year 2000 2010 and 2018 land-use change analysis were 278.74 mm 282.83 mm and 290.97 mm respectively and the average annual watershed sediment yield for the year 2000 2010 and 2018 land-use change analysis was 27.12 (t/ha) 27.69 (t/ha) and 28.93(t/ha) respectively. Generally there has been a gradual increase in sediment yield and surface runoff over the study period. This reflects the changes in land use land cover changes. In conclusion human activities contribute to land use hanges hence leading to flooding since they lead to increased sediment loading and stream runoff. The hydrological simulation provided a better understanding of the streamflow changes which is crucial for guiding policy-making on sustainable water resources by the relevant authorities.</td>

This project involved digitizing Registry Index Map creating a Graphical User Interfase (GUI) using Qt Designer creating a QGIS plugin using python programming language and intergrated with QGIS using QGIS-python Application Program Interfase(API) called pyqgis. The API was used to create functions and methods that were responsible in the working of the plugin. The plugin was then tested using the digitized RIM. KeCADASTRE was able to subdivide parcels while at the same time providing each parcel with a road network as requiredby law therefore it was rrecomended that survayors and physical planners can use the plugin to subdivide parcels in areas that are flat or relatively flat.</td>

              <td>Rising global warming and environmental change has led to extraordinary changes in nature as far as land use and land cover are concerned. Mainly because of the ever-growing populace people have encroached the river reserves to farm and even settle. When the rains come floods end up getting people unprepared and this leads to loss of lives damage of property among others. Despite the proposed in situ frequent monitoring so as to manage the fluctuations the ground stations are becoming fewer as their cost of maintenance is high and have limited coverage. For cases where there is availability of satellite imagery the challenge remains for extraction of Temporary Flooded Vegetation (TFV) areas so we can have a true account of the extent of the flood and its impact on the general environment. This study is aimed at assessing the flooding at the Sio River Delta hence delineate the flood-prone areas and also compute flooding probability of the lands closer to the delta as affected by Temporary Flooded Vegetation. In this study we seek to delineate water prone areas at the Sio river delta and then estimate flood probabilities of locations and parishes close to the River. A function of Difference in Value function is used to delineate the TFV and Temporary Open Waters (TOW) in Landsat imagery whereas in Sentinel -1 an RGB composite is used to identify the Flooded areas TFV using the double bounce back scatter. Urban areas considered to provide the highest double bounce backscatter are masked out. The study showed that Temporary flooded vegetation accounted to more than 50 per cent of the total flood extents with Busijo Busembe Bujwanga Sigalame sublocation and parishes having the highest concentration of flood probable areas. The results from the study would be useful in future planning evaluating and managing water resources in regards to flood control and land development.</td>

Assessment of soil erosion is useful in planning and conservation works in a watershed or basin. Modelling can provide a quantitative and consistent approach to estimate soil erosion and sediment yield under a wide range of conditions. In the present study the soil loss model Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS has been used to estimate soil loss in the Mara Basin located in the southwestern part of Kenya. The Mara River Basin is about 13750 km2 of which 65 per cent is located in Kenya and 35 per cent in Tanzania. The River runs through the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya and the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania the latter being a World Heritage Site and a Biosphere Reserve. Both the Mara and Serengeti are of global conservation significance and great economic importance at the local national and regional levels. The parameters of RUSLE model were estimated using remote sensing data and the erosion probability zones were determined using GIS. The estimated rainfall erosivity soil erodibility topographic and crop management factors range from 2948.16 to In the year 2000 the level of soil erosion in that region was estimated to be between 0-24.78(t ha-1 yr-1) while in the year 2010 the level of soil erosion was estimated to be between 0-26.68(t ha-1 yr-1) and in 2019 the level of soil erosion was estimated to be between 0-24.45(t ha-1 yr-1).

Water resources are one the resources that is under threat because of both over exploitation and climate change. This places a critical concern over its management for the sake of the future generations. This calls for proper mapping and studying the dynamics that influences their quantity and quality. The core objective of this study was to map groundwater potential zones quantifying recharge rates and mapping their Spatio-temporal variations (2000-2019) within Kajiado East constituency watershed. Using the trend analysis predict recharge rates in 2024 assuming the quasi-steady state of the catchment is maintained. In mapping groundwater potential zones weighted overlay was performed basing on the major controlling factors; land use and land cover rainfall soils geology drainage density lineaments and elevations. To establish the recharge rates within the watershed. WetSpass model was used with data prepared seasonally for long rains and short rains. The input data must be in ASCII format. Recharge rates for 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2019 was established. Analyzing their trend gave a better view of their Spatio-temporal variations. Using those trends prediction of annual recharge for 2024 was established to be around 31.12mm. Which will be a decrease from 2019. In conclusion the watershed holds moderate amounts of groundwater while the recharges rates vary both seasonally and annually. The Northern part of the catchment has high recharge rates in both seasons. The Southern part has higher recharge rate during long rains than short rains. From the study it was evident that smaller percentage of the precipitation infiltrates through the soils to form groundwater. As well the catchment has moderate potentiality of groundwater. Therefore there is need to also harvest water from other sources.</td>

                <td>Worldwide pipeline transportation systems serve as one of the great alternatives in distribution of petroleum and oil products on-shore. Accidents due to such infrastructure developments may be either intentional or unintentional and this may lead to more harm to the ecology. Therefore the need and presence of a well maintained and monitored oil pipeline system cannot be understated. The use and integration of Machine Learning and Data Driven Analytics were applied in the analysis of oil leak detection in Kiboko Town Makueni County. In the Near Real-Time System the oil data that is Rate of Flow Pressure and Velocity were the variables factored in the framework to analyse the pipeline system. To quantify the impact of the oil leak at Kiboko the various ecological components (soil plants and water) were analysed and the following indices derived GNIR NDVI ARVI NDSI and NDWI from Sentinel-2 MSI. The obtained results display that the indices show a great significant difference between the components condition at the leak spots and non-leak spots; between 2017 pre-spill and 2019 post spill dates. Once this was realized the spatial and temporal model was developed to show the different spots that are affected by the oil spill and parts that are unaffected based the ecological components. Hence this study has established the hidden potential underlying in the integration of Machine Learning and Remote Sensing techniques in the oil and petroleum sector.</td>

                <td>EVALUATION EXTENT OF LAND DEGRADATION IN KENYA CASE STUDY KERIO VALLEY</td>
                <td>Land degradation is a severe problem resulting from soil erosion agricultural extension and other activities. Land misuse without appropriate counteracting reserves in water and also soil management will result in extreme and severe degradation of the land. Therefore this will lead to loss of sources of revenue in the rural areas lessened water provisions and threaten the habitat of the wildlife. Studying land degradation is useful in planning and conservation works. The overall objective was to evaluate the extent of damage on land cover resulting from land degradation in Kerio Valley. This study has integrated Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote sensing techniques to assess and map potentially degraded areas using the RUSLE model. The study makes recommendations that include proposals on how land degradation can be mitigated. This study attempts to incorporate various sources of data and methodologies to analyse the consequences of land degradation in Kamnarok basin. The assessment of 1999 and 2019 situations indicates a general land cover changes in Kerio valley basin and increased vulnerability to soil erosion of the basin. This outcome also recognizes prospective degradation prone areas in which improvement actions should be appropriated to help shield additional degradation. A map showing probability zones has been derived to point out that the most quota of the area under study falls under low probability zone whereas a small portion is categorized under high and very high probability zone. This outcome could be of significance in enactment management of soil and conservation practices towards mitigation soil erosion in the catchment area. The LULC together with synthetic rainfall data were incorporated with RUSLE model and population data. The objective being to evaluate how agricultural expansion together with climate change and other factors are significant in the assessment of land degradation.</td>

                <td>This thesis starts with a description of the meanings of drought and aims to revisit the basic principles of drought drought classification drought indexes and the role played for drought assessment by Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems. Recent years have seen a great deal of attention on global drought scenarios due to the increase in water demand and looming climate change as a natural threat several climatological and hydrological criteria better describe drought. To develop strategies to alleviate the consequences of droughts an understanding of the interactions between these two sets of parameters is important. Droughts are known as a catastrophe for the world. A drought is a transient aberration in contrast to aridity which is a permanent characteristic of the atmosphere and is confined to low rainfall regions. The possibility of drought is a function of the susceptibility of an area to natural disasters and its susceptibility to sustained periods of water shortages. To make strides in mitigating the extreme effects of drought nations and regions need to strengthen their knowledge of the threats and the causes that cause vulnerability. To properly understand their drought climatology (i.e. the probability of droughts at various degrees of severity and duration) and to establish a robust and interconnected drought information system that combines climate and water resource variables such as precipitation temperature soil moisture snow cover reservoir and lake levels ground water levels it is important for drought-prone regions to have drought strategies and preparedness plans developed for all drought-prone nations that prioritize risk control rather than the conventional method to disaster management where the focus is on reactive emergency response initiatives. Crisis management lowers self-reliance and increases government and donor dependency.</td>

                <td>CORRELATION OF LAND SURFACE DISPLACEMENT WITH RISING WATER LEVELS USING SENTINEL-1 INSAR AND LANDSAT 8 IN LAKE NAKURU BASIN.</td>
                <td>Rising water levels in Kenya’s rift valley lakes in the recent past has intrigued many researchers. Most of the lakes including Lake Nakuru the focus of the study have had their water levels rise disproportionately flooding most of the surrounding area and causing great havoc. Most of the research previously done have majorly focused on the contribution of the increasing rainfall and ignored the effects of human activities and other forces operating in the basins. Land surface deformation which is an indicator of the cumulative destructive activities of both human and tectonic forces has also interestingly been on the rise in the recent past. This study therefore in an attempt to unravel the mystery of the rising water levels investigated the rate of surface displacement and attempted to correlate it with the rising water levels. This research has successfully quantified the increase in surface area of Lake Nakuru from 2015 to 2020 it has further characterized the lake’s basin. Surface displacement of the lake’s basin has also been investigated to a limited level due to challenges in data processing While it is not very clear from the research whether the rate of surface displacement has been increasing over the years yet there is evidence of significant displacement during the period of study. Land subsidence in particular is predominant in the northern region of the Lake Nakuru basin while land uplift is more common in the southern region. This displacement pattern means most of the waters from the southern region drains into the northern region (where Lake Nakuru is situated) due to uplift and that the southern region subsiding is increasing its capacity to hold more water making it vulnerable to flooding. The land use type most associated with the displacement is built-up areas and there is also a slightly high concentration of lineaments in the area largely affected by subsidence. On the other hand the size of Lake Nakuru has definitely increased over the years (by 9.27km 2 ) particularly between 2019 and 2020 (by 5.86 km 2 ) and this is no surprise because of the displacement patterns. However the linkage between surface displacement and the flooding waters and the attributive factors of land displacement are still not well established from this research. Therefore further research should be done to establish the effects of built-up areas and lineaments (an evidence of tectonic movement and faulting) on surface displacement and the collective effects of surface displacement on the rising water levels.</td>
